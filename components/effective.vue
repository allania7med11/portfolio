      <p>
        I was always passion with solving difficult problem and challenging my limits. I didn't want to just use programs as black box. I want to be able to create those programs to solve interesting problem. My environment didn't really support my decision so I decide to learn on my own. I decide to start by create a program that can solve any type of structure.
        I was able to create two applications that make structure analysis easier and more effective
