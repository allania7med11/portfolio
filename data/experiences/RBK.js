  description: `At RBK, I helped build and deliver Immersive Full Stack JavaScript Program curriculum based on the Hack Reactor model, providing technical and project management guidance to students building projects using cutting-edge technologies. As an instructional team member, I fostered guided discovery, eXtreme Learning, and a Socratic dialog approach to learning. I mentored students to challenge themselves and become autonomous developers capable of facing future challenges.`
