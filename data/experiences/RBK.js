  description: `RBK is an Immersive Full Stack JavaScript Program based on Hack Reactor curriculum with 1700 hours of training hours.
  I Work with other instructional team members to build & deliver materials and lectures addressing popular technologies and cohort-specific needs along with providing technical and project management guidance to small groups of students building exciting projects using cutting-edge technologies while promoting guided discovery, eXtreme Learning and a Socratic dialog approach to learning.
  It was an amazing and challenging experience when I became not only a technical mentor but also a life mentor encouraging students  to challenge themselves and helping them become autonomous developers able to face any future challenges.`
