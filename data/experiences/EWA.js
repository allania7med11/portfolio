    description: `I have always been passionate about solving difficult problems and challenging my limits. I didn't want to simply use programs as a black box, I wanted to create them to solve interesting problems. Despite my environment not being supportive, I decided to learn on my own. Through self-discipline and patience, I combined my civil engineering background and coding skills to create a website application for engineers, making structure analysis easy and effective.`
