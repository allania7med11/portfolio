  description: `Co-founded by Hack Reactor, RebootKamp opened in Tunisia in 2019. The autonomous and self discipline I showed while working at Effective Web App convince them to give me the opportunity to prove my skills by mastering the Hack Reactor program  and deliver to students in best way possible.I was amazed by the wealth of the program where it cover many technical skills such as advanced recursion,data structures,authentication,databases,Agile/scrum... and many frameworks like   
  Express,React,Angular,MongoDB...It was challenging to absorb all these knowledge in short period of time but the desire to help the students and contribute to their development push my skills to the limits.Therefore,I was able with my team to deliver great experience to the students and the day of their   graduation  was one of the best day in our life
