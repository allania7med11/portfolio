  description: `After demonstrating my autonomy and self-discipline while working at Effective Web App, I was given the opportunity to work for RebootKamp in Tunisia, which was opened in 2019 by Hack Reactor. As a Hacker in Residence, I mastered the Hack Reactor program and delivered technical lectures on various frameworks, including Express, React, Angular, and MongoDB. It was a challenging experience, but my team and I were able to provide an excellent learning experience for the students, and their graduation was a highlight of our time there.`
