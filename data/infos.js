  about: `As a self-taught developer with a background in civil engineering, I have spent the last 2 years honing my coding skills and creating an intuitive online structure analysis software for engineers. In addition to my self-study, I earned a Front End Nano Degree from Udacity, which required me to complete five projects that I am extremely proud of.
  My passion for teaching led me to work as a Hacker in Residence at RBK, where I not only mastered the Hack Reactor program but also challenged and supported my students in developing a growth mindset and becoming autonomous learners capable of tackling any future challenges.
  Eager to apply my knowledge and experience to a real-world international project, I transitioned to a full-stack developer role at Softcatalyst. Working in a collaborative environment, I was able to not only leverage my existing skills but also acquire new ones by working with a team to overcome real-life problems.
  Overall, I am a driven and dedicated developer who is committed to continuous learning and personal growth.
