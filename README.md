## 💼 Professional Experience

### Upwork
**Freelance Full-Stack Developer (Part-Time)** | Jun 2024 - Present

Developed Shoppingify – a full-featured eCommerce platform with clear separation between backend and frontend. The backend, built with Django, DRF, Django Channels, Celery, and Redis, handles business logic, real-time messaging with WebSockets, and background tasks. AI integration using OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, LangChain, and FAISS enables smart shopping assistance with conversational memory. The frontend, built with Next.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, and Material UI, provides a fast and responsive user experience. Application quality ensured through automated testing (Pytest for backend, Playwright for frontend) and monitored with Sentry. Code quality maintained using Husky, Lint-Staged, ESLint, Prettier, isort, Black, and Flake8. Dockerized deployments automated via Semaphore CI/CD pipelines and hosted on DigitalOcean. The client awarded a 5-star review, praising the platform’s quality, AI capabilities, and professional delivery.

### SOFTCATALYST
**Software Engineer** | Aug 2021 - Present

As a Full Stack Developer at SOFTCATALYST for the US-based client Pearl Certification, I design and optimize scalable applications using Django and ReactJS. My role includes integrating third-party services like ServiceTitan, Recurly, and Zendesk to streamline project management, subscription handling, and customer support. I leverage Celery to automate tasks such as PDF generation, email notifications, and webhook processing. Adhering to Agile methodologies, I lead sprint planning, conduct code reviews, and ensure feature stability with pytest, delivering robust, user-focused solutions.

### RBK Tunisia
**Hacker in Residence** | Jun 2020 - Aug 2021

At RBK, I contributed to the development and delivery of an immersive Full Stack JavaScript curriculum modeled on the Hack Reactor approach. I provided both technical and project management guidance to students as they worked with advanced technologies, supporting their project development and skill-building. As part of the instructional team, I promoted a guided discovery process, eXtreme Learning, and a Socratic dialogue approach, empowering students to challenge themselves and grow into autonomous developers prepared to navigate future industry challenges.

### EffectiveWebApp
**Founder & Full-Stack Developer** | 2018 - Jun 2020

With a background in structural engineering, I built a 2D structural analysis web app to better understand the inner workings of structural analysis software. The platform lets engineers design structures, apply loads, and instantly visualize internal forces, stress, and displacement through a clean, interactive interface. The project pushed me to learn independently, solve real problems, and build with clarity and purpose. It also sparked a mindset of continuous growth—driving me to constantly improve and reach new levels as a developer.

## 🎓 Education

### Udacity
**Nanodegree,  in Développement Web Front-End** | Aug 2020 - Dec 2020

As one of the top-performing students in the Front End Developer track, I earned a scholarship for the Udacity Nanodegree program. Through the program, which provided high-quality resources and challenging projects, I acquired unique skills in building responsive websites with CSS, developing interactive websites and UI applications with JavaScript and HTML, and connecting web applications to backend server data with JavaScript. I also learned how to automate application build and deployment using Webpack and improve website offline performance with Service Worker.

### Hack Reactor
** in Développement Web Full-Stack** | Jun 2020 - Oct 2020

After demonstrating my autonomy and self-discipline while working at Effective Web App, I was given the opportunity to work for RebootKamp in Tunisia, which was opened in 2019 by Hack Reactor. As a Hacker in Residence, I mastered the Hack Reactor program and delivered technical lectures on various frameworks, including Express, React, Angular, and MongoDB. It was a challenging experience, but my team and I were able to provide an excellent learning experience for the students, and their graduation was a highlight of our time there.
